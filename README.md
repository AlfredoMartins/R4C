# CARONA REMUNERADA

The Angolan population is increasing with each passing day, and development is one of
the points it aims to achieve. The use of modern technologies is one of the aspects that
developed countries have. In that order, it is found that the more users, More electronic devices
will be used as a function of time.

According to INE (National Institute of Statistics), the transport of most of the
population is totally dependent on taxis. As the taxi is a car intended for the passenger transport
where drivers charge a certain fare according to the taximeter that calculates the value according
to the distance and time spent on a route, this is a good way to improve taxi services in the
country. Transportation is the focus of this work which is divided into three parts, respectively:
Theoretical Rationale, Practical Rationale and Implementation. In the theoretical foundation it
was properly spoken on transport, then was the practical rationale where it was addressed on
the methodologies and technologies used for project implementation and finally the
implementation where a series of illustrations related to how of the application.

It is well known that a well designed and documented application can be reconstructed.
So in principle the Android platform was used for productivity reasons. To the User Interface
(UI) building, Adobe XD was the tool selected because of simplicity and performance that has
been presenting in the last years. Since the data Most important applications come from an
external server.
